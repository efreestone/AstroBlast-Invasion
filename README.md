# AstroBlast-Invasion
AstroBlast is a space shooter game for iOS, built with Objective-C and Sprite Kit.

Flying saucers are trying to invade. Tap the screen to shoot a laser ball and blast them out of the sky! Earn 100 or more points per saucer destroyed. Hit 2500 points and you win! But be warned, you’ll lose a life for every saucer that gets past you. Lose 3 lives and it’s game over. Shooting asteroids will earn you bonuses too. The “+1” asteroids will earn you an extra life while “X2” will add 1 to your multiplier. Watch out for those missed saucers though! This will not only cost you a life, it will also reset your multiplier to 1. 

Final score is based on time to reach 2500 and how many lives you have remaining. Can you beat the High Score?
